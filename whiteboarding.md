decompose, decompose, decompose  
start simple and work your way to complex  
answer the simplest question that solves a smaller scope of the question  

# verify

go through each step and track your variables  

# code

write code  
use as much short hard as you can  
`i` for index instead of `index`  
be verbal and explain why you are using the method you chose  

# debug

use sample input and output to check if your code checks out  
edit your code and catch any mistakes you may have missed:

ask the original question:  
* is it solved?  
* what are edge cases? (aka what breaks your code)
