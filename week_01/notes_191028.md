# what happens in a method stays in a method  
also called scope

'$' will throw off math operators because it is not an integer  
so saving dollar symbols should not be included in the variable  

# attribute reade, writer, and accessor
the short hand for writing
```ruby
def value1  
  @value1 = value1  
end  
```
instead use  
```ruby
attr_reader :value1, :value2, :value3  
attr_writer :value1, :value2, :value3  
attr_accessor
```

# you can pass an argument as a hash instead of multiple arguments
```ruby
def Class  
  def method(input_options)  
    @arg1 = arg1  
    @arg2 = arg2  
  end  
end  
input_options = { arg1: x, arg2: y}  
new = Class.new(input_options)  
```
