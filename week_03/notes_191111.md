make a TIL gist for your github account and keep it up to date  

to remember the difference between the RESTful action `create` vs `update`  
`create` adds to the database via the model and requires a **comma** between each attribute  
`update` **does not use a comma** because it invoke the attribute as a method  

all the functions that exist in the `controller.rb` file can be referred to as:  
* functions
* methods
* actions
but the term `action` refers to the functions that are involved with the HTTP web request/response
