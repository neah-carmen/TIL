when invoking the `.find_by` method on an instance of a Model  
```ruby
@variable = Model.find_by(id: params[:id])  
```
the argument takes the form `(id: params[:id])`  
**take note of the placement of the colons**  

the partial view file should call non-instance variables so that it can be used by both views/index and views/show
