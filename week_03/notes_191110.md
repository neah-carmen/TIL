```
if 5 # is truthy  
  puts "WAT?"  
end  
```
`false` or `nil` are considered falsey  
`!!(expression)` to determine if something is truthy or falsey  

# &&
`&&` moves forward as long as the previous object is truthy  
`5` evaluates to 5  
`5 && 6` evaluates to 6  

# ||
`||` moves forward as long as the previous object is falsey  
`5` evaluates to 5  
`"hello" || 5 || true` evaluates to "hello"
