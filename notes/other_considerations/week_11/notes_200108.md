## other frameworks

## Vue.js

[Vue.js](ttps://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-vue/#getting-started)  
same framework we have been working with  
just introducing some new concepts

## React

[React](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/#create-react-app)
very different framework
there are no templates -- everything is javascript

## Nuxt.js

[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/installation)
built on top of Vue.js  
but with more structure/architecture
