the equivalent of `config/routes.rb` in Vue.js is `src/router/index.js`

```javascript
import Page from "../views/Page.vue";

const routes = [
  {
    path: "/page",
    name: "page",
    component: Page
  }
];
```

the equivalent of `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` in Vue.js is `src/App.vue`

the frontend does not need to be RESTful
