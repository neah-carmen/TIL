when making backend RESTful API's the only routes necessary are:

- index
- create
- show
- update
- destroy

`new` and `edit` are technically for the frontend

the routing you use in `src/router/index.js` does not need to follow RESTful naming conventions

```javascript
import PostsIndex from "../views/GetPosts.vue";

Vue.use(VueRouter);

const routes = [
  {
    path: "/posts/",
    name: "get-posts",
    component: GetPosts
  }
];
```

using RESTful naming conventions in `src/router/index.js` entails

```javascript
import PostsIndex from "../views/posts/Index.vue";

Vue.use(VueRouter);

const routes = [
  {
    path: "/posts/",
    name: "posts-index",
    component: PostsIndex
  }
];
```

```vue
<script>
import axios from "axios";

export default {
  data: function() {
    return {
      message: "All your Places",
      places: []
    };
  },
```

`data:` is a specific object type that insures each data instance is separate from others

```vue
  created: function() {
    axios.get("/api/places").then(response => {
      this.places = response.data;
    });
  },
  methods: {}
};
</script>
```

think of the `created:` as an initializer  
these are functions that are run before the page loads so that they are immediately available
