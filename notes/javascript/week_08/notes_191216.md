using a url segment in Vue.js works in the `src/router/index.js`
very similar to how it works in Rails

```javascript
const routes = [
  {
    path: "/posts/show/:id",
    name: "posts-show",
    component: PostsShow
  },
```

> the problem with multi-page applications is that you need to make sure the page works when you hit refresh as you separate out the RESTful routes

to add a css framework to your Vue.js

```bash
npm install css-framework --save
```

then edit `src/views/main.js`

```javascript
import "css-framework";
import "css-framework/css/framework.css";
```

to concatenate in a template in Vue.js

```vue
{{ model.attrib1 + model.attrib2 }}
```
