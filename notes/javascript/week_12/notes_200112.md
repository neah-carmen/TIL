## creating a model with sequelize

to create a model with sequelize

```bash
sequelize model:create --name Model --attributes attrib1:string,attrib2:string,attrib3:string
```

this creates a `model.js` and a `migration.js`

separately you need to run the command

```bash
sequelize seed:generate --name Model
```

to create a seeds file that specific model

since seed files are separated by model you can run them all at once or separately

```bash
sequelize db:seed --seed path/to/seeder/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-Model.js
```
