## creating a model with sequelize

to create a model with sequelize

```bash
sequelize model:create --name Model --attributes attrib1:string,attrib2:string,attrib3:string
```

this creates a `model.js` and a `migration.js`

separately you need to run the command

```bash
sequelize seed:generate --name Model
```

to create a seeds file that specific model

since seed files are separated by model you can run them all at once or separately

```bash
sequelize db:seed --seed path/to/seeder/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-Model.js
```

model associations are explicitly created in their own section of the `model.js`

```javascript
FakeModel.associate = function(models) {
  // it is important to prepend the keyword models in front of the Model name
  FakeModel.belongsTo(models.User, {
    foreignKey: "userId"
  });
};
return FakeModel;
```
