## user authentication in express with sequelize (cont'd)

this does not work like it does in Rails

```bash
sequelize db:migrate db:seed:all
```

you have to do it in separate commands

```bash
sequelize db:migrate
sequelize db:seed:all
```

because express is not opinionated, adding `bcryptjs` is not enough to use within your project

the obvious place that requires the usage of bcrypt is the user model

_but also you need to add it to the user seeds file_

```javascript
const bcrypt = require("bcryptjs");

const salt = bcrypt.genSaltSync();
var password = "pasword";
password = bcrypt.hashSync(password, salt);
```
