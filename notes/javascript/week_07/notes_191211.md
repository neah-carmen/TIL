how to start your Vue.js server

```bash
npm run serve
```

> until you make a web request nothing that happens on your frontend is real

in your create method, the object does not exist  
so you have to use `this.attrib`

```javascript
methods: {
  createBook: function() {
    var params = {
      title: this.title, <!-- note the usage of this -->
      price: this.price, <!-- note the usage of this -->
      summary: this.summary, <!-- note the usage of this -->
      cover_image: this.cover_image, <!-- note the usage of this -->
    };
  }
};
```

versus in the update method, the object does exist
so you have to use `object.attrib`

```javascript
methods: {
  updateBook: function(book) {
    var params = {
      title: book.title,  <!-- note the usage of book -->
      price: book.price,  <!-- note the usage of book -->
      summary: book.summary,  <!-- note the usage of book -->
      cover_image: book.cover_image,  <!-- note the usage of book -->
    };
  }
};
```

> for the frontend you are creating html elements and connecting methods to them
