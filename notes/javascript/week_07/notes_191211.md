how to start your Vue.js server

```bash
npm run serve
```

> until you make a web request nothing that happens on your frontend is real

in your create method, the object does not exist  
so you have to use `this.attrib`

```vue
methods: { createBook: function() { var params = { title: this.title, price:
this.price, summary: this.summary, cover_image: this.cover_image };
```

versus in the update method, the object does exist
so you have to use `object.attrib`

```vue
methods: { updateBook: function(book) { var params = { title: book.title, price:
book.price, summary: book.summary, cover_image: book.cover_image };
```

> for the frontend you are creating html elements and connecting methods to them
