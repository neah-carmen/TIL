globally install a node package

```bash
npm install -g package_name
```

save a node package to a project

```bash
cd vue_project_name
npm install package_name --save
```

the package `axios` is used to handle http requests  
we import this in to our vue project in `main.js`  
`import axios from "axios";`
as well as in to the in the `Page.vue` file

declare the variables in the `data:` section

```vue
<script>
...
  data: function() {
    return {
      textVariable: "Hello world",
      arrayVariable: [],
      numberVariable: 42
    };
...
```

so that it can be used in the `methods:` section

```vue
...
  methods: {
    resetVariable: function() {
      textVariable: "",
      arrayVariable: [],
      numberVariable: "" };
</script>
...
```

> Vue.js is about defining data and then defining how that data changes
