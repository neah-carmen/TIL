## test driven development or TDD

1. Write a test
2. Make the code work
3. Refactor

> only write the tests that you need

## integration tests

first add `rspec` to your Rails project and then

```bash
rails generate rspec:integrations integration_name
```

this creates `spec/requests/integration_name.rb`  
then you can use `rspec` language to write tests for your controller and models

> you get a lot of value out of doing integration tests
> it helps test the route, controller, and view

> testing a model with `rspec` can be useful if your Models have complex code
