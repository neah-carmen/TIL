## testing

you will use the `rspec` gem to test your Ruby code

```ruby
RSpec.describe Class do
  describe "#method" do
    it "the code that the method should execute" do
      code = Class.new
      result = code
      expect(result).to eq(value)
    end
  end
end

```

and then in your terminal, to run rspec

```bash
rspec code.rb
```

## using RSpec with Rails

in your `Gemfile` add rspec to the development group

```
group :development, :test do
  gem "rspec-rails", "~> 3.9"
end
```

and then run the commands

```bash
bundle install
rails generate rspec:install
```

when you run `rspec` with your Rails app, the data in the development database is left untouched  
when `rspec` executes it uses a separate test database
