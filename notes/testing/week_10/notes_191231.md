## considerations for writing rspec model tests

when you write the code for your model test in rspec

```ruby
RSpec.describe Model, type: :model do
  describe "#method" do
    it "should execute the #method" do
      test_model = Model.create(name: "test_model")
      test_model.method
      expect(test_model.attrib).to eq("foo_bar")
    end
```

a scenario might pass when it is executed with Insomnia but fail with `rspec`  
the `Model.create` does not seem to be the exact same method as defined in the `model_controller.rb`  
and you might have to be more explicit in with how the code is run in the test
