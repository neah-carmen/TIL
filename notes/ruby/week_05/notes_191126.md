html

```html
<form method="post" action="http://localhost:3000/api/">
  <input type="text" name="params" value="" />
  <input type="submit" name="" value="Send POST request" />
</form>
```

forms are how you can get params from a user

> don't try to memorize html  
> try to understand the basics and look up the specific implementations you want to do

> your web browser only understands 3 languages: html, javascript, and css  
> html does not understand ruby

```ruby
# in show.html.erb
# erb is embedded ruby and it lets you use ruby code
<% @instance_variable.each do |varaible| %>
<%= variable.method %>
<% end %>
```

you create an html controller in the same way you created an api controller

```bash
rails generate controller controller_name
```

```ruby
  # the create action becomes two separate actions in HTML
  get "/products/new" => "products#new" # this is a new concept, we need to somehow accept params from the user
  post "/products" => "products#create" # this is similar to the api create method
```
