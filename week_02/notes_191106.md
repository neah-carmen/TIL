# new concept: query parameters
`query_params`  

the addition of extra information after the url  
that can be passed to Rails  
`https://www.google.com/search?q=query`  

`params`  
is a specific variable that Rails uses for query params  
```
@attrib_1 = params["attrib_1"]  
@attrib_2 = params["attrib_2"]  
@attrib_3 = params["attrib_3"]  
```
while not explicity a hash  
the structure of a query param is hash-like  
`http://localhost:3000/namespace/route?attrib_1=10&attrib_2=true&attrib_3=search`  
Rails will parse the query params as  
`Parameters: {"attrib_1"=>"10", "attrib_2"=>"true", "attrib_3"=>"search"}`  

params that are passed this way are strings  
so remember to implicitly convert numbers to integers if you wish to use them as such
