# new concept: query parameters
`query_params`  

the addition of extra information after the url  
that can be passed to Rails  
`https://www.google.com/search?q=query`  

`params`  
is a special variable that Rails uses for query params  
```
@attrib_1 = params["attrib_1"]  
@attrib_2 = params["attrib_2"]  
@attrib_3 = params["attrib_3"]  
```
while not explicity a hash  
the structure of a query param is hash-like  
and the key to the params is a string  
`http://localhost:3000/namespace/route?attrib_1=10&attrib_2=true&attrib_3=search`  
Rails will parse the query params as  
`Parameters: {"attrib_1"=>"10", "attrib_2"=>"true", "attrib_3"=>"search"}`  

params that are passed this way are strings  
so remember to implicitly convert numbers to integers if you wish to use them as such  

> If you get stuck... rubber duck  
you can use the rubber duck method when you get stuck  

you can have as many controllers as you want in your Rails app  

`segment_params`  
the second way for a user to pass information to Rails  
this method is preferable for SEO  
because in the `query_params` method, all info after the ? is not searchable  
versus with `segment_params` method, the param becomes part of the url  

in `routes.rb`:  
```
namespace :api do  
    get "/letter_a/:variable" => "params_games#letter_a_checker"  
end  
```
in `controller.rb`:  
```
def letter_a_checker  
    @name = params["variable"]  
    render "letter_a.json.jb"  
  end  
```

the controller does not care which method it received the params  
so a `query_param` and a `segment_param` can both use the same controller action
