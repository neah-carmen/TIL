when invoking the `.find_by` method on an instance of a Model  
```ruby
@variable = Model.find_by(id: params[:id])  
```
the argument takes the form `(id: params[:id])`  
**take note of the placement of the colons**  

the partial view file should call non-instance variables so that it can be used by both views/index and views/show

```bash
git clone repo_url  
```  
to clone a repo from github

to make changes to your Rails/postgresql database  
```bash  
rails generate migration MigrationName  
```  
you want to use Rails to make database changes and not sql commands  

a `string` for a database only holds 255 characters  
a `text` for a databse can be of unlimited length
