# about Ruby conditionals

```ruby
if 5 # is truthy
  puts "WAT?"
end
```

`false` or `nil` are considered falsey  
`!!(expression)` to determine if something is truthy or falsey

# &&

`&&` moves forward as long as the previous object is truthy  
`5` evaluates to 5  
`5 && 6` evaluates to 6

# ||

`||` moves forward as long as the previous object is falsey  
`5` evaluates to 5  
`"hello" || 5 || true` evaluates to "hello"

# update route path and controller action

delete "/products/:id" => "products#destroy"
```

for the time being uncomment lines 8 - 16 in `app/config/initializers/cors.rb`  
so that the front end is allowed to communicate to the backend even though they are at two different servers
