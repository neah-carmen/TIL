how to do email validations using the built in Ruby URI library  
```ruby  
  validates :email, format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }  
```

You should have knowledge of SQL  
but it doesnt need to be perfect because Rails can do some of the queries under the hood  

```ruby
Object.find_by # returns 1 item  
Object.where # returns an array of items  
Object.where("atrrib > ?", params[:attrib]) # using the conditional with the ? will  
Object.all.order(attrib: :desc) # is equivalent to Object.all.order({attrib: => desc:})  
Object.count # use this versus Object.all.length
```
