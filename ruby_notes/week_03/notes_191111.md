make a TIL gist for your github account and keep it up to date  

to remember the difference between the RESTful action `create` vs `update`  
`create` adds to the database via the model and requires a **comma** between each attribute  
`update` **does not use a comma** because it invoke the attribute as a method  

all the functions that exist in the `controller.rb` file can be referred to as:  
* functions  
* methods  
* actions  
but the term `action` refers to the functions that are involved with the HTTP web request/response  

dont forget to add `.save` method to your patch / update action in the controller  

---

for data manipulations or functions not pertaining to the controller  
there is a file located in `app/models/` that can add more logic pertaining to the model  

> fat models, thin controllers, thin views  

*you need to restart irb each time you update your model*  

---

to make your views DRY  
you use a partial  
```bash  
touch _recipe.json.jb  
```
```ruby  
render partial: "recipe.json.jb", locals: { recipe: @recipe }  
```
