# modules
using modules helps you solve issues that arise with inheritance  
```ruby
module Examplify  
  def method  
    puts 'Displays text'  
  end  
end  
class NewClass  
  include Examplify  
    puts 'Hello World!'  
  end  
end  
```

# maintaining code with many lines can be difficult  
so you can split that code up over multiple files  
and use require to access them  
`require Class`  

# other uses for modules
you can also use modules to help isolate variables  
this is referred to as name spacing  
`Module::Class.method`  

# pair programming
rules for pair programming  
one person is the driver (typing)  
one person is the navigator
