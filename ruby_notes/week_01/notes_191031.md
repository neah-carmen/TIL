```
GET http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stuff

en.wikipedia.org = domain

http module for ruby

# what terminology do i search for to get non-html data?  
you want to include the term 'api' in your search  
the equivalent concept of *user names and passwords* that api's will use is an **api key**  
be very careful of your usage of api keys  
**_specifically sanitize your api keys if you push your code to github_**

`system "clear"`  
this line of code can be used to clear the terminal via Ruby  

reddit can be parsed into a json file  
all you need to do is append .json to any valid reddit url
