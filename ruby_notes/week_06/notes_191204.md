```javascript
// when you are defining a function
function name(arg)
// do not forget to add the opening curly brace
function name(arg) {
  // code here
}
```

```ruby
# ruby has the .times method
10.times do
  puts "hello"
end
```

```javascript
// there is no equivalent method in javascript
// and you have to use a for loop
for (var i = 0; i < 10, i++) {
  console.log("hello");
}
```

hashes in ruby are called objects in javascript

```javascript
// when incrementing a variable to loop through an array
i = i + 1;
// is the same as
i += 1;
// is the same as
i++;
```

in ruby you have the map, select, reduce methods
the equivalent in javascript is the map, filter, reduce methods
**also you can not iterate through an object in javascript like you can with a hash in ruby**
