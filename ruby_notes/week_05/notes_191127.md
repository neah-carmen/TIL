full stack rails app  
```ruby
  # the update action becomes two separate actions in HTML  
  get "/products/:id/edit" => "products#edit" # this is a new concept, we need to somehow accept params from the user  
  patch "/products" => "products#update" # this is similar to the api update method  
```

```ruby  
# web browsers only understand get and post requests  
<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="patch" /> # needs to be added to the form  
# as a work around that you can use in Rails make a patch request  
```
