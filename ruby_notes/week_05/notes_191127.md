full stack rails app

```ruby
  # the update action becomes two separate actions in HTML
  get "/products/:id/edit" => "products#edit" # this is a new concept, we need to somehow accept params from the user
  patch "/products" => "products#update" # this is similar to the api update method
```

web browsers only understand get and post requests

```ruby
 # needs to be added to the form
<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="patch" />
# as a work around that you can use in Rails make a patch request
```

```ruby
# links can only make get requests so the delete request has to be made with a form
<form method="post" action="/products/<%= @product.id %>">
    <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="delete">
    <input type="submit" value="Delete this product">
  </form>
```
