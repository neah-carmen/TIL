order.status can be `carted` or `Carted`  
but make sure you are consistent with all of your statuses  
```ruby  
status: "carted" => status: "purchased"  
status: "Carted" => status: "Purchased"  
```

Rails will sanitize *all inputs* except for **string interpolation**  

---  
don't save your api keys in your code  
save them as environment variables
```ruby
response = HTTP.get"(https://newsapi.com/v2/everything?=#{params[:search]}&api_key=#{ENV["API_KEY"]}")
```

or use the figaro gem  
```ruby  
gem 'figaro'  
```

whenever you change `application.yml` you need to restart Rails
