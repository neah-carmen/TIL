the complicated way to do a has_many to has_many association  
you might be better off writing your own methods in the models  
```ruby
belongs_to :model, class_name: "Model"  

has_many :join_tables, class_name: "Model", foreign_key: "model_id"  
has_many :models, though: :join_table, source: :join_table  
```
