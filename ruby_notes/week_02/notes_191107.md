# body_params

i dont want to send an email or a password as a `query_parm` or `segment_param`

`post "/body_params_url" => "controller#body_params_method"`  
`post` requests are more secure than a `get` request

if you get this error `Invalid Authenticity Token`  
find `application_contoller.rb` in your controller directory  
and uncomment this line `# protect_from_forgery with: :null_session`

`query_params`, `segment_params`, `body_params` are all just `params` to Rail  
you can even mix and match params methods
