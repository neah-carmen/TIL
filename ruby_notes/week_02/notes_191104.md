in order for a variable to be passed between controller and a view  
you should use an instance variable  
`variable`  

persistent data cannot live inside of the controller  
persistent data is stored in a database  
for the purpose of this course, postgresql is what will be utilized  

rails display model (updated)  
web request -> api route -> api controller (data from model) -> api view -> web response  

to create a new rails sample_app  
```ruby
rails new sample_app  
cd sample_app  
rails db:create  
rails server  
```

```ruby
rails generate controller api/name_of_your_controller  
rails generate model ModleName attrib1:value1 attrib2:value2 ... attrib9:value9  
```
attrib:value where value is data type in postgresql  
```bash  
rails db:migrate  
```  
'commit' the code change from rails to postgresql  
```bash  
rails console  
```  
loads irb within your rails app  

# C - R - U - D  
create - read - update - delete  

you can point insomnia at your rails server to interact with its views  

`nil:NilClass`  
> this error message is one of the most common ones you will encounter  

`rails_app/app/models/`  
location of the methods created by rails  

`rails_app/app/db/`  
location of the rails and ruby code for your database
