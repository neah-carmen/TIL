difference between authentication and authorization:  

authentication = who are you?  
authorization = what are you allowed to do?  

```ruby
# in the controller add the following
before_action :authenticate_user  
```

```ruby
# default: false is important!
add_column :users, :admin, :boolean, default: false  
```

```ruby
# in application_controller.rb
  def authenticate_admin
    unless current_user && current_user.admin
      render json: {}, status: :unauthorized
    end
  end

# in the controller
before_action :authenticate_admin, except: [:index, :show]  
```
