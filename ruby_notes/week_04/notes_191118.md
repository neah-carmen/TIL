you can use `Model.new` to create the new entries in your database so that Rails recognizes them  
but then use Postico to actually change the attributes to what they should be  
_however make sure that you have no validations enabled_

```ruby
belongs_to :supplier
# is the same as
def supplier
  Supplier.find_by(id: supplier_id)
end

has_many :images
# is the same as
def images
  Image.where(product_id: id)
end
```

# the stateless web

the server does not save that status of an interaction  
the client remembers the status  
html remembers states via cookies  
api can remember states via json web tokens

rails uses the `bcrypt` gem to manage passwords

in the user model

```ruby
has_secure_password # this is important
```

rails uses the `jwt` gem to manage json web tokens  
you will generate a sessions controller but not a sessions model
