you can use `Model.new` to create the new entries in your database so that Rails recognizes them  
but then use Postico to actually change the attributes to what they should be  
*however make sure that you have no validations enabled*  

```ruby
belongs_to :supplier
# is the same as
def supplier
  Supplier.find_by(id: supplier_id)
end 

has_many :images
# is the same as
def images
  Image.where(product_id: id)
end
```
