foreign key  
column added to a model to connect it to a second model

> a farmer has many cows, the farmer brands those cows

active record queries can call an Model instance  
so you can do any method that you could do normally with that instance

```ruby
product = Product.first
supplier = product.supplier
supplier.name
```

# data structures: hashes

hashes are fast because while they use an array-like structure  
the "index" of that "array" is the computed hash value of the key  
this computed hash value is "mostly unique" and therefor becomes a o(1) operation
