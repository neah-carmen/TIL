jwt is like a cookie  
but its more like a hash  
this prevents people from altering the contents of the jwt  

```bash
rails generate migration AddAttribToModel attrib:type
```

```ruby
user_id: current_user.id,
```

```ruby  
has_many Models # this is plural  
belongs_to Model # this is singular  
```
